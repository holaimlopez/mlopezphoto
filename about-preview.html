                I specialize in creative portraiture and political communications. Beyond the technical, My real specialty is people. My focus is on finding the genuine warmth and emotiveness in the subjects at hand.

            <p>
                I'm a firm believer that the best results come from collaborative teamwork. To me, a successful project is one where the team leaves a tired, laughing, and deeply satisfied with what was built.
