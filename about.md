**Bronx-born. NYC-based. 15 years of light shaping experience.**

I specialize in creative portraiture and political communications. Beyond the technical, My real specialty is people. My focus is on finding the genuine warmth and emotiveness in the subjects at hand.

<p>I'm a firm believer that the best results come from collaborative teamwork. To me, a successful project is one where the team leaves a tired, laughing, and deeply satisfied with what was built.

<p>If you're looking for a partner who brings an authentic, polished, touch to a well-executed vision, let's build something together.
