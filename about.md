**Bronx-born. NYC-based. 15 years of light shaping experience.**

I specialize in creative portraiture and political communications. Beyond the technical, My real specialty is people. My focus is on finding the genuine warmth and emotiveness in the subjects at hand.

I'm a firm believer that the best results come from collaborative teamwork. To me, a successful project is one where the team leaves a tired, laughing, and deeply satisfied with what was built.

If you're looking for a partner who brings an authentic, polished, touch to a well-executed vision, let's build something together.

Let's build something together that feels as good as it looks.
